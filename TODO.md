# Bugs:
- [ ] loading 1, 2 and 4 bit have problems with correct setting pixels in image, when byte is split into few pixels, pixels have to be "wraped" into next row sometimes
- [ ] in bigger files offset/padding is calculated wrong and this cause shift during loading file
# Todo
 - [ ] loading 32 bits BMPs
 - [ ] DEV - function to save image to text file, easier checking for errors in larger BMPs
